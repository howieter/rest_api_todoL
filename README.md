# Rest API Todo List
REST API for task management (TODO list).

## Run
Being on the rest_api_todoL, run this command "go run ./cmd ."
After that the program will create database (using your username), create the table and fill it. So now you can use postman to try some requests. You have to be sure that postgresql is active.
